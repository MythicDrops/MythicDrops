MythicDrops supports two primary drop strategies:

- single drop strategy
- multiple drop strategy

<Aside type="tip">
  You most likely want to use the multiple drop strategy! Read on for why!
</Aside>

## Single Drop Strategy

Single drop strategy works more or less how the name implies: every mob can drop at most 1 item.

Whenever a mob is killed, a random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared against the `drops.item-chance` value
from your [config.yml]. If the random number is lower than the `drops.item-chance` value, the mob will have a chance to drop an item.
For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume a value of 1.0 (100% chance to drop an item).

If the mob has a chance to drop an item, we start working our way down the item type list, starting with tiered items. We generate a
random number between 0 and 1 and compare it against the `drops.tiered-item-chance` value from your [config.yml]. If the random number is less
than the `drops.tiered-item-chance` value, the mob will drop a tiered item using the [weight](/guides/weight/) system. If the random number is
larger than or equal to the `drops.tiered-item-chance` value, we go down to the next type. This repeats for item types in the following order:

1. tiered items
2. custom items
3. socket gems
4. unidentified items
5. identity tomes
6. socket extenders

With that in mind, lets assume the following section from the [config.yml]:

```yaml
drops:
  strategy: single
  broadcast-target: WORLD
  item-chance: 1.0
  tiered-item-chance: 0.25
  custom-item-chance: 0.1
  socket-gem-chance: 0.2
  unidentified-item-chance: 0.1
  identity-tome-chance: 0.1
  socket-extender-chance: 0.1
```

With this configuration, the chance for a tiered item to drop is 25%: `drops.item-chance (1.0) * drops.tiered-item-chance (0.25) = 0.25`

With this configuration, the chance for a custom item to drop is 7.5%: `drops.item-chance (1.0) * (1.0 - drops.tiered-item-chance (0.25)) * drops.custom-item-chance (0.1) = 0.075`

As you can likely see, this is very easy to configure in a way where it's very difficult to get the drops that you want to get. This led to the creation of the multiple drop strategy.

## Multiple Drop Strategy

Multiple drop strategy allows every mob to drop at most 1 item of every type.

Similarly to the single drop strategy, whenever a mob is killed, a random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared against the `drops.item-chance` value
from your [config.yml]. If the random number is lower than the `drops.item-chance` value, the mob will have a chance to drop an item.
For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume a value of 1.0 (100% chance to drop an item).

Where this then differs from single drop strategy is that every drop type is independently rolled against if the mob can drop an item.

Using the same config.yaml as before:

```yaml
drops:
  strategy: single
  broadcast-target: WORLD
  item-chance: 1.0
  tiered-item-chance: 0.25
  custom-item-chance: 0.1
  socket-gem-chance: 0.2
  unidentified-item-chance: 0.1
  identity-tome-chance: 0.1
  socket-extender-chance: 0.1
```

With this configuration, the chance for a tiered item to drop is 25%: `drops.item-chance (1.0) * drops.tiered-item-chance (0.25) = 0.25`

With this configuration, the chance for a custom item to drop is 10%: `drops.item-chance (1.0) * drops.custom-item-chance (0.1) = 0.1`

With this configuration, the chance for both a tiered item and a custom item to drop is 2.5%: `drops.item-chance (1.0) * drops.tiered-item-chance (0.25) * drops.custom-item-chance (0.1) = 0.025`

This is a much more straightforward way to configure your drops, as you can more easily understand the true chances for items to drop.
