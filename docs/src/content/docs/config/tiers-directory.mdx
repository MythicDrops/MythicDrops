MythicDrops has a lot of configuration options. Below is the contents of a tier YAML with inline explanations of what
each configuration option does.

Display color and identifier color combinations must be unique.

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  Display color and identifier color are deprecated and have been replaced with
  the `item-display-name-format` key. Please use that instead.
