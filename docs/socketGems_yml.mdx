### New in 6.2.x

#### New Socket Command Type

There is a new `SUDO` socket command type that only works with the new format detailed below.

#### New Socket Command Format

You can now specify socket commands via a new format:

```yaml
commands:
  thisisauniqueidentifierkey:
    runner: SUDO # CONSOLE and PLAYER work here too
    command: mythicdrops spawn tier # Put the command you want the player to run here
    # Put any permissions you want granted temporarily (just as long as it takes to run the command) here
    permissions:
      - mythicdrops.command.spawn.tier
```

### New in 6.0.2

You can now combine the fields `all-of-item-groups`, `any-of-item-groups`, and `none-of-item-groups` like below.

This will only allow the item to be applied to an item with a material that is:

- in the armor item group
- in the chest or head or leggings item groups
- not in the leather item group

```yaml
Harden I:
  trigger-type: WHEN_HIT
  item-groups:
    all-of-item-groups:
      - armor
    any-of-item-groups:
      - chest
      - head
      - leggings
    none-of-item-groups:
      - leather
  # other configuration...
```
