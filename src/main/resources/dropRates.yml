# Each creature has a number beside it
#   that determines its likelihood of
#   spawning with an item when multiplied
#   against the global spawn chance in the
#   config.yml
# If your global spawn chance is 0.5 and you
#   want zombies to always spawn with items,
#   set ZOMBIE to 1.0
# You can find a list of mobs at the link below:
