## Configuration

MythicDrops has a lot of configuration options. Below is the contents of the
creatureSpawning.yml with inline explanations of what each configuration option does.

```yaml
version: 5.1.0
## Allows toggling whether or not certain types of mob spawns will actually
## be eligible to receive MythicDrops items. Only works if display-mob-equipment
## is set to true in config.yml.
spawnPrevention:
  ## Should mobs spawned by a spawn egg be prevented from receiving items?
  spawnEgg: true
  ## Should mobs spawned by a mob spawner be prevented from receiving items?
  spawner: true
  ## Should mobs spawned by a custom reason be prevented from receiving items?
  ## This would typically be mobs spawned by plugins.
  custom: true
  ## Should mobs spawned by reinforcements (zombie mechanic) be prevented from
  ## receiving items?
  reinforcements: true
  ## Should mobs spawned by drowning be prevented from receiving items?
  drowned: true
  ## Allows you to set a Y level per world where mobs will not receive items
  ## if they spawn above it.
  ## In the default config, mobs spawned above 255 in a world named "world"
  ## will not receive items.
  above-y:
    world: 255
## Multiplier against the percentages (item-chance, tiered-item-chance, etc.)
## from config.yml.
##
## Each mob that you want to drop items needs to be included in this section.
## If the mob is not included in this section, they are treated as having a
## multiplier of 0.0.
