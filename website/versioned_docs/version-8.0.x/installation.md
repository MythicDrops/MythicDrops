MythicDrops is fairly straightforward to install. Download the ZIP from one of the below options
and unzip it, copying both the `mythicdrops.jar` and `MythicDrops` folder into your
server's `plugins` folder.

## Option 1: Spigot

You can download the official releases of the plugin [via Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mythicdrops.6114/).

Releases will be uploaded with a changelog attached. You can download an older version
[via the `Version History` page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mythicdrops.6114/history).

## Option 2: Discord

ZIPs of in-development code will regularly be uploaded to the [#builds channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/FaCzDwU).

Release candidate uploads (by ToppleTheNun) will have changelogs attached.

Automatic development uploads (by Autobot) won't have changelogs attached.
